              26. Dispute Resolution and Optional Arbitration
            </h3>
            <p class="terms-text">
              In the event of any dispute, claim, question, or disagreement
              between You and FrontM (“Dispute”), You and FrontM shall first use
              reasonable best efforts to settle the dispute, claim, question, or
              disagreement. To this end, You and an authorized member of
              FrontM’s legal department (or other representative of FrontM
              designated by the legal department) shall consult and negotiate
              with each other in good faith and, recognizing their mutual
              interests, attempt to reach a just and equitable solution
              satisfactory to both parties. Neither You nor FrontM shall file or
              pursue any Disputes in any court, administrative, arbitral, or
              other adjudicative body prior to engaging in such consultations
              and negotiations.
            </p>
            <p class="terms-text">
              You agree that any Disputes shall be adjudicated in the courts of
              London, United Kingdom. You agree to submit to the exclusive
              jurisdiction of such courts with respect to any Disputes and agree
              not to bring any Disputes in any other court or adjudicative body.
              You hereby consent to venue and personal jurisdiction in such
              courts with respect to such Disputes and irrevocably waive any
              right that You may have to assert that such forum is not
              convenient or that any such court lacks jurisdiction.
            </p>
            <p class="terms-text">
              Notwithstanding the adjudication requirement above, for any
              Disputes involving ten thousand UK pounds (10,000 UK pounds) or
              less, either party may choose to resolve such Dispute through
              binding, non-appearance-based arbitration (i.e., arbitration
              conducted online, through written filings, and/or via
              teleconference). Such arbitration shall be conducted through an
              established alternative dispute resolution provider mutually
              agreed upon by the parties, and any judgment rendered by the
              arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. The
              arbitrator’s decision shall be final and legally binding.

              In the event of any litigation (including arbitration) between You
              and FrontM, the non-prevailing party shall reimburse the
              prevailing party for all reasonable and documented attorneys’
              fees, costs, and expenses relating to the Dispute.
