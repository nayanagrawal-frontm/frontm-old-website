              FrontMs’ websites, e-mail messages, and advertisements may use
              “cookies” and other technologies such as tracking, re-marketing
              tags, and pixels based on context, e.g., a search query, a channel
              You are reading, or inferred interests. These technologies help us
              better understand user behavior, tell us which parts of our
              websites people have visited, and facilitate and measure the
              effectiveness of advertisements and web searches. We treat
              information collected by cookies and other technologies as non
              personal information. We design and target advertising based on
              how You interact with FrontMs. If You do not wish to receive ads
              targeted to Your interests from FrontMs’, You can choose to limit
              ad tracking, which will opt Your FrontMs ID out of receiving such
              ads regardless of what device You are using. You may still see ads
              based on context like a search query or a channel You are reading.
              FrontMs and our partners also use cookies and other technologies

              referring and exit websites and applications, operating system,

              information about our user base as a whole. FrontMs may use this

              services to Your customers. With respect to the customer data that
              You provide to FrontMs, FrontMs is a data processor and will
              comply with its obligations under the GDPR; but with respect to
              Your customers, You are probably a data controller, and if any of
              Your customers is a citizen or a resident of a country in the
              European Union, then You must ensure that You comply with Your
              obligations as a data controller under the GDPR; namely, You must
              ensure that You afford Your Customers the rights identified in
              section (a) above. FrontMs sells software; it does not provide

              uses GDPR-compliant Data Processing Addendum (DPA) provided by AWS
              Amazon. GDPR introduces adherence to a “code of conduct” as a
              mechanism for demonstrating sufficient guarantees of requirements

              uses AWS Amazon’s compliance with the CISPE Code of Conduct. The
              CISPE Code of Conduct provides customers with additional
              assurances regarding their ability to fully control their data in
              a safe, secure, and compliant environment when they use services
